# LIBFT

The purpose of the LIBFT project was to recreate some of the C Standard library in order to familiarise myself with commonly-used functions and gain an increased understanding of the C language. The project included standard functions such as string split and string trim, as well as some non-standard (but still useful) functions such as a function to iterate through and properly free linked lists.
