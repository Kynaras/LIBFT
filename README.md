# LIBFT

My very first coding experience and project at WeThinkCode! The purpose of the LIBFT project was to recreate some of the C Standard library in order to familiarise myself with commonly-used functions and gain an increased understanding of the C language. The project included standard functions such as string split and string trim, as well as some non-standard (but still useful) functions such as a function to iterate through and properly free linked lists.

The functions themselves are located inside the /includes folder. Many of them require main functions in order to be tested. For posterity's sake and my own reference, I have included some of the simple mains I used when first writing and testing these functions in the /mains folder.

As my first proper project at WeThinkCode, LIBFT was a way to reinforce and add onto what I had learnt during the C Bootcamp. Even now I can see many things I would change if I had to rewrite the project. Perhaps revisiting LIBFT would be a fun personal project in the distant future to see how much I have grown as a programmer. :)
